                    The breakout of COVID-19 has forced many workers and students to relocate from their traditional work or college environments to a workspace at home which can be unsuitable to many individuals. As explored by a lot of research, this massive change 
                    from work environments to virtual environments due to COVID-19 has dealt a big blow to collaboration among teams. Collaboration among teams is key to delivering goals and meeting deadlines.
                    The virtual environment makes it difficult to achieve this effectively as tools can be overly complicated or simply donâ€™t have good enough team features.

                    Teamspace is a web application that is designed to improve the online experience when working in a team. Teamspace allows users to store and share team related files in an organised manner while being able to view, edit or delete files at the same time in real time.
                    The overall aim of this project is to provide a platform that improves the online collaboration experience for a team that needs to store and work on files together.
                    The name of this Web app Teamspace, comes from having a space for a team to collaborate in. The tools team choose are a major part of improving the experience.

                    <b>What is a Team Board?</b>
                    <p>A team board is used to store and manage team related files using Filespaces. It is aimed to encourage users to stay organised and keep all team related files 
                        on the same platform that is accessible to all team members. Team boards are invite only. Users can manage tasks using the minimal to-do list feature
                    </p>
                    
                    <br></br>
                    <b>What is a Filespace?</b>
                    <p>A filespace is essentially a space for users files. It acts as a folder inside of the team boards. Filespaces are used to encourage
                        users to seperate their files into appropriate folders so they are easy accessible and easier to find. For example one filespace could be for UI/UX, another 
                        could be for the marketing team etc..
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>How can I collaborate with team members on a file?</b>
                    <p>It is as simple as joining the same file at the same time. Once on the file begin typing and the other user(s) that are present in the file
                        can see what is being typed. Once the file is saved it is saved for all users.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>How do I create a Team board?</b>
                    <p>Any user can create a team board for their team. It is as simple as selecting the "New" button that is located on the home page for the users boards
                        . This will then prompt the user to enter in the board details into a form, once the form is completed just select create board. 
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>What is the point of choosing a Board Color?</b>
                    <p>The idea of the board theme color is so that users can colour coordinate their boards. Users can label their boards by colour. For example
                        all boards related to work can be green, while all personal boards can be blue etc..
                    </p>
                    <b>Can a another user view my profile?</b>
                    <p>In the current version of Teamspace, only a user can view their own profile, other members of teamspace, do not have the capability to 
                        view a another users profile. This may be changed and added in future.
                    </p>
